# Asteroids Game

A playable clone of the classic Asteroids arcade game built using Python and Pygame. Features include player movement, shooting, and collision detection between the player, bullets, and asteroids.

This project was developed as part of a guided course on Boot.dev to practice object-oriented programming and build interactive gameplay using a custom game loop and state management.

## ğŸš€ How to Run

> ğŸ“¦ Prerequisite: Python **3.10 or higher** must be installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aarondesousa/asteroids.git
   cd asteroids
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (to manage dependencies like Pygame and avoid cluttering the global environment):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

> ğŸ’¡ Tip: To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.
